    This application is useful if you want to verify your HTML either
    offline or markup that is protected on an intranet. This server should
    provide the same sort of validation as <http://validator.w3c.org>.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
  W3C_HOME
    Will be used by both "w3c-validator-install.sh" and
    "w3c-validator-server.psgi" to install and search for external files.
    See "INSTALLATION" for details.

  HOME
    Will be used by both "w3c-validator-install.sh" and
    "w3c-validator-server.psgi" to install and search for external files.
    See "INSTALLATION" for details.

    The directory holding files will be: "$HOME/.w3c-validator-server"

INSTALLATION
    After downloading/installing this module you have to install some more
    external dependencies. This can be done by using the
    w3c-validator-install.sh script, bundled with this package:

        $ w3c-validator-install.sh all

        # install libraries. Require sudo, apt-get and cpanm
        $ w3c-validator-install.sh libs

        # fetch files from http://validator.w3.org
        $ w3c-validator-install.sh files

        # rewrite config to defaults
        $ w3c-validator-install.sh config

    The files will be installed to your home directory, or current directory
    if "Makefile.PL" is found. See
    <http://validator.w3.org/docs/install.html> for more details.
